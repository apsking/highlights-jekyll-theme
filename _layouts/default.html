				Thank you all for patiently awaiting our updates and continuing to show us your love and support!
				We were ultimately not able to keep our August 2020 wedding ceremony plans, so we are waiting to
				exchange our vows in your presence as soon as we are able. In light of lingering unpredictability
				about the feasibility of large gatherings this coming summer, we have made the decision to postpone
				our wedding once again. We are confident that this decision will bring back some of the original
				excitement and anticipation that comes from planning a wedding with all of our friends and family!
			</p>
			<p>
				Our new wedding date is <b>June 25, 2022</b>. We cannot wait for you to join us for this long-awaited
				ceremony and celebration! See our earlier updates
				<a href="https://youtu.be/9BBFiegj4K4" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/mo-GHO8rEww" target="_blank">here!</a>

					The Couple
					<a href="#header" class="scrolly goto-home" title="To Top"></a>
				</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Kimberly and Alex have been solving problems together since day one. They met in Multivariate Calculus class at the University of Puget Sound in 2011. They were great study partners, often meeting up for breakfast before class to help each other with difficult homework problems and studying for tests together.
			</p>
			<p>
				When they returned to school in January 2012 after winter break, they were greeted with a rare 8 inches of snow in Tacoma. The university declared a snow day, and after a fun-filled day of playing in the snow with friends, Alex and Kimberly shared their first kiss under the falling snow on Puget Sound’s campus.
			</p>
			<p>
				Throughout college, they supported one another through their different areas of study and took breaks to attend formals and explore the Tacoma waterfront. After graduation, they moved 40 miles north to Seattle to start their careers, still enjoying the close company of many college friends.
			</p>
			<p>
				In August 2018, Alex and Kimberly made the big move to St. Louis, MO for Kimberly to attend Saint Louis University’s PhD program in Clinical Psychology, while Alex continued to work remotely for Amazon. They were thrilled to adopt a black-lab mix puppy into their home in March 2019, who they named Rainier to honor their Pacific Northwest roots. Little “Rainy” has happily settled into the routine of napping throughout Alex’s work days and greeting Kimberly with a wagging tail when she gets home every day.
			</p>
			<p>
				About seven years after they shared their first snowy kiss, on the eve before 2019, Alex and Kimberly found yet another romantic snowy setting. The two set out for a hike to Franklin Falls in the Cascade Mountains outside of Seattle, trekking through sparkling snow to the foot of the waterfall. As they stood admiring the magnificent cascade, Alex dropped to one knee and proposed to Kimberly. Once Kimberly enthusiastically accepted his proposal, he pointed out Kimberly’s parents, Doug and Maureen, who had been huddled in the cold to document the moment. They enjoyed a quick celebration at the waterfall, then hiked back to the warmth to share the news with friends and family.

				Kimberly grew up sharing many magical moments with Aunt Anne, and she cherishes their memories of crafting, walking along the beach, and visiting the butterflies together. As life goes, the years have brought several transitions and new family members - including Alex! When Alex and Kimberly started imagining their wedding day, they both knew Anne offered something above and beyond the traditional wedding officiant. They are humbled to journey into marriage with her as their guide.

				Edrina and “Kimmy” bonded over their mutual goofy senses of humor one unforgettable volleyball season in 2005. They went separate ways for college and beyond, but no amount of distance stopped them from traveling to cheer each other across the graduation stage. Through multi-hour phone calls, they have kept each other up-to-date on everything from first kisses to worldly travels! Kimberly is honored that Edrina will be by her side on this day, as she has been on countless others.

			<p>
				Since college, Alex, Kimberly, and Taiga have shared many adventures together. Just after Kimberly and Taiga graduated with the UPS Class of 2015, Taiga and his parents generously invited Kimberly and Alex to visit their home in Tokyo, Japan. Once back in Seattle, the three continued to explore new territory together – experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen and discovering new mountaintop views. As a strong proponent of Alex and Kimberly’s relationship, Taiga is the perfect person to give Alex that extra boost of confidence!
