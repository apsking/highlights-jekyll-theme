					The Couple
					<a href="#header" class="scrolly goto-home" title="To Top"></a>
				</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Kimberly and Alex have been solving problems together since day one. They met in Multivariate Calculus class at the University of Puget Sound in 2011. They were great study partners, often meeting up for breakfast before class to help each other with difficult homework problems and studying for tests together.
			</p>
			<p>
				When they returned to school in January 2012 after winter break, they were greeted with a rare 8 inches of snow in Tacoma. The university declared a snow day, and after a fun-filled day of playing in the snow with friends, Alex and Kimberly shared their first kiss under the falling snow on Puget Sound’s campus.
			</p>
			<p>
				Throughout college, they supported one another through their different areas of study and took breaks to attend formals and explore the Tacoma waterfront. After graduation, they moved 40 miles north to Seattle to start their careers, still enjoying the close company of many college friends.
			</p>
			<p>
				In August 2018, Alex and Kimberly made the big move to St. Louis, MO for Kimberly to attend Saint Louis University’s PhD program in Clinical Psychology, while Alex continued to work remotely for Amazon. They were thrilled to adopt a black-lab mix puppy into their home in March 2019, who they named Rainier to honor their Pacific Northwest roots. Little “Rainy” has happily settled into the routine of napping throughout Alex’s work days and greeting Kimberly with a wagging tail when she gets home every day.
			</p>
			<p>
				About seven years after they shared their first snowy kiss, on the eve before 2019, Alex and Kimberly found yet another romantic snowy setting. The two set out for a hike to Franklin Falls in the Cascade Mountains outside of Seattle, trekking through sparkling snow to the foot of the waterfall. As they stood admiring the magnificent cascade, Alex dropped to one knee and proposed to Kimberly. Once Kimberly enthusiastically accepted his proposal, he pointed out Kimberly’s parents, Doug and Maureen, who had been huddled in the cold to document the moment. They enjoyed a quick celebration at the waterfall, then hiked back to the warmth to share the news with friends and family.

				Kimberly grew up sharing many magical moments with Aunt Anne, and she cherishes their memories of crafting, walking along the beach, and visiting the butterflies together. As life goes, the years have brought several transitions and new family members - including Alex! When Alex and Kimberly started imagining their wedding day, they both knew Anne offered something above and beyond the traditional wedding officiant. They are humbled to journey into marriage with her as their guide.
			</p>

			<p>
				Edrina and “Kimmy” bonded over their mutual goofy senses of humor one unforgettable volleyball season in 2005. They went separate ways for college and beyond, but no amount of distance stopped them from traveling to cheer each other across the graduation stage. Through multi-hour phone calls, they have kept each other up-to-date on everything from first kisses to worldly travels! Kimberly is honored that Edrina will be there to share in laughter and love on her wedding day.
			</p>
			<img src="assets/images/taiga-cropped.jpg" class="bio-portrait right" />
			</br/>
			<p>
				Since college, Alex, Kimberly, and Taiga have shared many adventures together. Just after Kimberly and Taiga graduated with the UPS Class of 2015, Taiga and his parents generously invited Kimberly and Alex to visit their home in Tokyo, Japan. Once back in Seattle, the three continued to explore new territory together – experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen and discovering new mountaintop views. As a strong proponent of Alex and Kimberly’s relationship, Taiga is the perfect person to give Alex that extra boost of confidence on his wedding day!

			<h3>
				By when should I RSVP?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Any time - starting now! And please, no later than June 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020. Thank you!
			</p>
			<h3>
				Do you have a gift registry?
			</h3>
			<p>
				For those so inclined, you can find our
				registry <a href="https://www.blueprintregistry.com/registry/kimberlyandalex" target="_blank" class="scrolly">here</a>.
				That said, after many years together, we have many of the material goods we could ever think to use.
				We welcome you to attend without purchasing a gift! If you cannot attend, in lieu of a gift, we
				welcome you to send a wish, a memory, or an update on how you are doing.
			</p>
			<h3>
				What time should I arrive at the ceremony?
			</h3>
			<p>
				TBD.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Is there a dress code?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Click the “see more” link under <a href="#schedule" class="scrolly">each event</a> to see suggested attire
				for each event. For the wedding, we are going for dressy casual attire.
				At our venue, there is a gravel pathway to the ceremony and reception
				lawn. We will be on grass most of the evening. You can scroll up to
				see the weather forecast in the area.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Are there any other events that I should know about?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Yes! Go ahead and check out our
				<a href="#schedule" class="scrolly">schedule</a>, which includes
				all of the wedding events.

			</h3>
			<p>
				Yes, please make sure to include any food preferences with your RSVP.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Will there be a cash bar?
			</h3>
			<p>
				No. We will have an open bar serving beer and wine!
			</p>
			<h3>
				Is there parking readily available at the ceremony?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Yes! There is plenty of parking available. Parking will be a short
				walk from the ceremony, on a groomed, gravel pathway. Parking
				will be in a low-cut grass field behind the ceremony site. For
				those who would prefer not to walk the distance, we ask that you
				be dropped off in front of the house and then have your car parked
				in the lot.

			</h3>
			<p>
				TBD.

			</p>
			<h3>
				Are kids welcome?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Absolutely. Please let us know with your <a href="#rsvp" class="scrolly">RSVP</a> so that we can
				get an idea as to how many little ones to expect!
